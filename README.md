# CIS-678-Machine-Learning-Project-4

## Overview
This project provides personalized diet recommendations based on user profiles. It utilizes two approaches:
1. **Neural Networks with Autoencoder Model**: Captures latent features of recipes and recommends meals based on cosine similarity.
2. **Caloric-Based Recommendation**: Suggests meals based on the user's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and caloric needs.

## Features
- Personalized meal recommendations.
- Visualization of nutritional distributions and correlations.
- Two distinct recommendation approaches for flexibility.
